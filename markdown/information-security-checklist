- [ ] Monitor logs for signs of suspicious activity.
- [ ] Retain logs for a defined period based on regulatory requirements.
- [ ] Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions for log analysis.
- [ ] Regularly review and tune monitoring and alerting rules.

### 11. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Develop and document a business continuity plan (BCP).
- [ ] Establish a disaster recovery plan (DRP) and ensure it is tested regularly.
- [ ] Maintain offsite backups and ensure they are recoverable.
- [ ] Identify critical business functions and prioritize their recovery.
- [ ] Ensure communication plans are in place for business continuity.

### 12. Vendor and Third-Party Management
- [ ] Assess the security posture of vendors and third-party service providers.
