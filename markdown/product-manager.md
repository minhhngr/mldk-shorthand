Establishing a “Hierarchy of Needs” to Prioritize Layers of Strategy and Execution

J.W.

Product Manager, 1,000-person SAAS company

A few months ago, I found myself juggling a whole bunch of distinct-but-related conversations with my counterparts in engineering and design about what we should build and how we should build it. Our team leadership meetings oscillated between high-level questions around goals and strategy and more tactical questions around staffing and team processes. These topics seemed to blend and swirl together until it was difficult for us to move things forward without getting stuck.

In the hopes of bringing some clarity to our conversation, I reached out to the project manager on our team who has a lot of experience navigating complex challenges within organizations. Working together, we walked through the most important decisions we had to make as a team, which unsurprisingly boiled down to “What goals should we be working toward, and what should we be doing to achieve those goals?” From there, we created a visual “hierarchy of needs” (Figure 10-2) showing the specific information that was most important for us to figure out to answer those critical prioritization questions.

“Having this hierarchy of needs visualized helped us focus on seeking out and synthesizing the information that was most important to get our team unblocked and moving forward. With our visual hierarchy in place, we were able to put a hold on conversations about roadmaps, staffing, and process while we focused on better understanding company-wide goals and building out our team’s product strategy. Visualizing and prioritizing the different levels of information we needed to make important decisions helped us better manage our own time and efforts, ultimately putting us in a position where we could get unblocked and build momentum.”

## Good Strategy Is Inexorably Tied to Execution

### Checklist

* Give up on trying to find the single correct canonical definition of terms like vision, mission, strategy, and objectives.
* Remember that the purpose of all these big fancy words is to help your team understand what goals you are working toward and how you intend to achieve those goals Stay focused and keep it simple.
* Think of outcomes and output as a connected system, not an either-or choice.
* If you want your team to have more leeway and freedom around output, get specific about the outcomes you want to achieve and the timeline in which you want to achieve them.
* Experiment with different goal-setting formats and frameworks like SMART goals, CLEAR goals, and OKRs to see what works best for your team.
* Resist the urge to approach strategy as something separate from—and more important than—execution. Keep strategy and execution closely connected at all times.
* Take your goals and strategy for a “test drive” with your team as quickly as you can, to see if they can actually help the team make better decisions.
* Keep your strategy so simple and straightforward that anyone on your team can quickly and easily recite it without having to refer to a deck or document.
* If somebody asks you for a “vision” or a “strategy” and you aren’t sure what they mean, ask them to provide a few examples.
* Stop reading this chapter and go jot down a quick and dirty draft of your team’s goals and strategy, then workshop it together. Seriously!
