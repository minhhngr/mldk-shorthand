# Redis Cluster Testing

This document outlines the key questions to ask and steps to follow when testing a Redis Cluster to ensure it is properly configured, performant, and reliable.

## Key Questions

### Setup and Configuration

1. **Is the configuration of the nodes in the Redis Cluster correct?**
   - Are the nodes correctly assigned their roles (master/slave)?
   - Is the Redis Cluster operating correctly in the production environment?

2. **Are the Redis configuration parameters optimized for your workload?**
   - Are timeout settings, memory limits, and maximum connections appropriately configured?

### Performance and Load

3. **Can the Redis Cluster handle high loads?**
   - Does the cluster meet your throughput and latency requirements?
   - Using tools like `redis-benchmark`, how many requests per second can the cluster handle?

4. **How does the Redis Cluster perform as the number of concurrent connections increases?**
   - Does the cluster maintain performance with increasing numbers of client connections?

### Data Consistency

5. **Is data replicated consistently between master and slave nodes?**
   - Is data on the slave nodes consistent with the master?
   - Is there any data loss during replication?

6. **Is data correctly restored after a failover?**
   - Is data consistent after a master node failure and a slave node promotion to master?

### Failover and Reliability

7. **Does failover occur correctly when the master node fails?**
   - Does the Redis Cluster automatically detect and switch roles between nodes?
   - Is the role switch quick and non-disruptive?

8. **Can the cluster recover from various failure scenarios?**
   - Can the cluster recover after one or more nodes lose connection or fail?

### Monitoring and Maintenance

9. **Do you have effective monitoring tools for the Redis Cluster?**
   - Can you monitor performance metrics and receive timely alerts about issues?
   - Are you using tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the Redis Cluster?

10. **Is the cluster regularly maintained and updated?**
    - Are patches and security updates applied promptly?

### Application Integration

11. **Can your applications connect and interact with the Redis Cluster correctly?**
    - Can services and applications such as Authorization Service, and API Gateway connect and use the Redis Cluster without errors?

12. **Is the performance of your applications affected by the Redis Cluster?**
    - Do applications run smoothly and efficiently when using the Redis Cluster?

### Security

13. **Is the Redis Cluster properly secured?**
    - Have you set up authentication and encryption for Redis connections?
    - Do you have access control and permissions correctly configured for Redis nodes?

# Redis Cluster Testing Checklist

## Pre-requisites
- [ ] Ensure all Redis nodes are up and running
- [ ] Verify network connectivity between all nodes in the cluster
- [ ] Install Redis CLI on the machine where tests will be run

## Configuration Verification
- [ ] Check Redis version compatibility across all nodes
- [ ] Validate the cluster configuration files for each node
- [ ] Confirm the master-slave relationship is correctly set up

## Basic Functionality Tests
- [ ] Connect to the cluster using Redis CLI
- [ ] Execute basic read/write operations
  - [ ] SET key value
  - [ ] GET key
- [ ] Test data distribution across nodes

## Replication Tests
- [ ] Verify data replication from master to slaves
  - [ ] Insert data on the master node
  - [ ] Check data presence on slave nodes
- [ ] Simulate master node failure and observe slave promotion
- [ ] Verify data consistency post failover

## Performance Tests
- [ ] Measure read/write latency
- [ ] Benchmark throughput using a tool like `redis-benchmark`
- [ ] Perform load testing with concurrent connections

## Resilience and Recovery Tests
- [ ] Simulate network partition and recovery
- [ ] Test node restart and rejoining the cluster
- [ ] Validate cluster's self-healing capabilities

## Application Integration Tests
- [ ] Test service/application database operations
- [ ] Verify Authorization Service database transactions
- [ ] Check API Gateway caching mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure API functions correctly via the Gateway

## Monitoring and Alerts
- [ ] Set up monitoring for Redis cluster (e.g., Redis Sentinel, Prometheus)
- [ ] Configure alerts for critical metrics (e.g., memory usage, CPU usage, node availability)

## Post-Testing
- [ ] Review logs for any errors or warnings
- [ ] Document test results and any issues found
- [ ] Plan for any necessary adjustments or fixes

## Conclusion
- [ ] Summarize the test outcomes
- [ ] Recommend next steps based on findings
- [ ] Ensure the cluster is stable and ready for production use
